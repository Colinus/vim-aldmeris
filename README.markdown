aldmeris.vim
============

Aldmeris is a port of the gedit oblivion theme for vim.

Features:
* tango colors palette
* support 256 colors for terminal emulators
* option to use terminal base colors in the colorscheme: by setting term
colors with a tango palette, the result is very close to the gui version
* tpope's fugitive integration: well recognizable colors for the output of
:Gstatus, and for git objects.
