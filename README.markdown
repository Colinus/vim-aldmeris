aldmeris.vim
============

Aldmeris is a vim colorscheme based on oblivion for gedit.

Features:

* tango colors palette
* support 256 colors for terminal emulators
* option to use terminal base colors in the colorscheme: by setting term colors with a tango palette, the result is very close to the gui version
* tpope's fugitive integration: well recognizable colors for the output of :Gstatus, and for git objects.
